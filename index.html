            <h2>[ ABOUT THIS NODE ]</h2>
            <p>Willow Arms Public Access isn't just another channel. It's a glitch in the system, a backdoor to broadcasts the algorithms forgot. Raw, unfiltered, and sometimes nonsensical â€“ if you're tired of the curated feed, welcome to the static.</p>

                <h3>:: The Bonfire Podcast ::</h3>
                <p>Gather 'round the digital flames. Unstructured conversations about everything and nothing. Conspiracy theories, bad life choices, deep dives into meme lore, and whatever else gets pulled from the collective unconscious. It's like shouting into the void, but someone might actually be listening.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="show">
                <h3>:: [vibe]rations ::</h3>
                <p>Visual noise and auditory signals designed to resonate. Music videos that feel pulled from a forgotten BBS or a late-night infomercial from the future. Plug in and let the waves wash over you. Headphones recommended.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="show">
                <h3>:: POV: mom & dad are fighting again ::</h3>
                <p>Step into a memory loop. Fragmented television signals flicker in a digital dreamscape while the echoes of domestic conflict hum beneath. Surreal, unsettling, and oddly nostalgic. Don't worry, the existential dread is standard.</p>

            <div class="show">
                <h3>:: [iinnermission] ::</h3>
                <p>Initiate chill sequence. Low-fidelity visuals and ambient soundscapes for focus, relaxation, or just zoning out. Escape the high-res grind and find peace in the pixelated quiet. Warning: May induce unexpected tranquility.</p>
