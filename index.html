            <h2>[ WHAT IS THIS PLACE? ]</h2>
            <p>Willow Arms Public Access is less of a network and more of a signal bleeding through the cracks. We found a microphone, a camera that still works sometimes, and a corner of the internet nobody seems to own. Low budget? Absolutely. Filtered? Not a chance. This is what happens when the internet forgets to look away.</p>

            <h2>[ SCHEDULED DISTURBANCES ]</h2>
            <p>Viewer discretion is... recommended, we guess?</p>

            <div class="show">
                <h3>:: The Bonfire Podcast :: Unfiltered Rambling</h3>
                <p>Pull up. Someone's talking, probably about something they shouldn't be. Conspiracy theories, questionable life choices, strong opinions loosely held, and tangents that go nowhere. It's like a conversation you'd run away from at a party, but required viewing here.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="show">
                <h3>:: [vibe]rations :: Signals From The Unseen</h3>
                <p>Music and visuals that feel like they were scraped off a haunted hard drive. Found footage, glitch art, music that doesn't quite fit anywhere else. It's the soundtrack to Browse the internet at 3 AM when things get weird. Plug in if you dare.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="show">
                <h3>:: POV: mom & dad are fighting again :: Reliving The Trauma</h3>
                <p>A dreamlike descent into familiar discomfort. Old TV static, muffled arguments echoing from another room. It's oddly therapeutic? Maybe? Like watching someone else's awkward home videos from a dimension next door. You are not alone... probably.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="show">
                <h3>:: [iinnermission] :: Required Downtime</h3>
                <p>Okay, breathe. Slow down. Lo-fi visuals and ambient sound for when you just need to... exist quietly for a bit. Perfect for background noise while you question all your life choices, or just need a break from the internet screaming at you. Don't get too comfortable.</p>
