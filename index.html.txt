            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Willow Arms Public Access ain't your fancy big city TV. We're somethin' else entirely. Local broadcasts, unique perspectives, and a general sense of "what in tarnation?" Keep it locked here for shows you won't find anywhere else.</p>

                <h3>The Bonfire Podcast</h3>
                <p>Gather 'round and listen to folks talk 'bout... things. Usually starts with one topic, ends up discussin' squirrel strategies or the proper way to deep fry a bicycle. You know, important stuff.</p>

                <h3>[vibe]rations</h3>
                <p>Need some tunes that feel right? We got music videos that might make you tap your foot or question reality. Good for cruisin', cleanin' the shed, or just starin' blankly at the screen.</p>

                <h3>POV: mom & dad are fighting again</h3>
                <p>Relive those awkward moments in a hazy, dreamlike state. Old TV streams, muffled arguments in the background. It's... an experience. Therapy is cheaper, but this is on TV!</p>

            <div class="show">
                <h3>[iinnermission]</h3>
                <p>Our take on that lo-fi chill vibe. Relaxin' visuals, calm sounds... maybe a banjo twangin' softly in the distance. Perfect for studyin' (or sleepin'). Brand new!</p>
